- Need more practice with gridsystem-layouts.
- Once a week to full study CSS, manage time with ongoing lectures. 
- Need to lookup more CSS architecture. 
- Check up more psuedo elements for interesting effects and tricks. 
- This website is made on 12h (Saturday crunch). Might need to spend more time on upcoming assignments and stop spending time on side-websites-projects.
- Stop using heavy images.
- Try to make more re-useable classes instead of "bound to page" classes. Need better structure with em and spend some more time on BEM naming convention.
